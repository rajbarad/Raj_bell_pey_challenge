I have included two folders, one labeled "myProgram" and "mySimulation".

myProgram:  

This folder includes my program which is implemented as a java class. The class is called myProgam, which contains a method called: public String myProgram(int x, int y, int z, int r, float b)
            
This method and can be called and will take 5 inputs. It will return a string with my response either "betray" or "cooperate".
            
The class also includes a short discription of my program and my reasoning along with more information about my second folder "mySimulation", which was used to test my program.

mySimulation:  
This folder includes another paackage called "Bell_challange" which was used to simulate the game. More information on my program can be found in the comments section of myProgram.
